## ? **Development Strategy**

### **Incremental Development**
The roadmap is designed for incremental value delivery:
- **Working tools** available from Phase 3 onwards
- **Continuous integration** of new features
- **Backward compatibility** maintained throughout
- **Modular architecture** allows parallel development

### **Professional Development Practices**
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit tests and integration tests
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in profiling and optimization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and recovery
- **Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with implementation

## ?? **Technical Milestones**

### **Phase 1-2: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**

- ? Timeline scrubbing and navigation

### **Phase 5: Animation Playback (Weeks 13-16)**
- ? Real-time animation player with callbacks
- ? Movement data visualization and preview
- ? Dual data system (pattern + movement) working together

### **Phase 6: State Machine Editor (Weeks 17-20)**
- ? Visual state graph editor
- ? State transition editing with conditions
- ? Integration with timeline system

### **Phase 7-8: Production Ready (Weeks 21-28)**
- ? Complete project management with auto-save
- ? Undo/redo system with batch operations
- ? Professional polish and optimization
- ? Testing suite and quality assurance

## ? **Development Phases Overview**

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **1-2** | 4 weeks | Foundation | Working Clay UI with tabs |
| **3** | 4 weeks | Tool Integration | Unified editing interface |
| **4** | 4 weeks | Timeline | Multi-track timeline system |
| **5** | 4 weeks | Animation | Real-time playback engine |
| **6** | 4 weeks | State Machine | Visual state editor |
| **7** | 4 weeks | Advanced Features | Project management, plugins |
| **8** | 4 weeks | Polish | Production-ready editor |

## ? **Build System & Tools**

### **CMake Configuration**
- **Multi-platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS support
- **Dependency Management**: SDL3, OpenGL, Clay UI
- **Build Configurations**: Debug, Release, with profiling options
- **Testing Integration**: Unit tests and integration tests

### **Development Tools**
- **Profiling**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Memory Management**: Custom memory pools for performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and logging
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture from day one

## ? **Quality Assurance**

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Core system functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-system interaction
- **Performance Tests**: Timeline and animation performance
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Professional animator feedback

### **Performance Targets**
- **Timeline Rendering**: 60 FPS with 1000+ keyframes
- **Animation Playback**: Frame-perfect timing at 60 FPS  
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for typical projects
- **Load Times**: < 2 seconds for character data

## ? **Success Criteria**

### **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
- ? All three tools integrated into unified interface
- ? Basic timeline with VSE integration
- ? Animation playback with frame accuracy
- ? Project save/load functionality

### **Professional Release**
- ? Complete state machine editor
- ? Advanced timeline features (keyframes, interpolation)
- ? Export to all necessary formats
- ? Professional UI polish and workflows
- ? Comprehensive documentation and help system

### **Competitive Feature Parity**
Matching or exceeding capabilities of:
- **Guilty Gear Strive's** internal animation editor
- **Arc System Works'** development pipeline
- **Street Fighter** development tools

## ? **Risk Management**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Clay UI Learning Curve**: Mitigated with early prototyping
- **VSE Complexity**: Architecture already understood and documented
- **Performance with Large Data**: Memory pooling and optimization planned

### **Project Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Modular architecture allows feature prioritization
- **Timeline Pressure**: Each phase delivers working functionality
- **Team Coordination**: Clear documentation and interfaces defined
