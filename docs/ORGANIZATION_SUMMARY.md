# ML2 Project Organization Summary

## ? Analysis Results

### ? **What's Already Great**
Your project has **excellent documentation organization**:
- `docs/` directory is perfectly structured with clear categories
- Architecture documentation is comprehensive and well-written  
- Build instructions are complete and detailed
- System designs are well-documented

### ? **Main Issue: Root Directory Chaos**
- **106+ loose files** scattered in the root directory
- Hard to find specific files or understand project structure
- Mixed file types (source, build, assets, docs) all together
- No clear organization of the main source code

## ?? **Recommended Solution**

### **New Structure Overview**
```
mlfixtest/
„¥„Ÿ„Ÿ src/           # All source code organized by system
„¥„Ÿ„Ÿ assets/        # Game data and asset files
„¥„Ÿ„Ÿ build/         # Build system and generated files  
„¥„Ÿ„Ÿ tools/         # Development tools and scripts
„¥„Ÿ„Ÿ reference/     # API documentation and references
„¥„Ÿ„Ÿ assembly/      # Assembly code and wrappers
„¥„Ÿ„Ÿ docs/          # ? KEEP AS-IS (already perfect)
„¤„Ÿ„Ÿ [existing subdirs]  # ? KEEP AS-IS (hooks/, menu/, etc.)
```

### **Key Benefits**
- **? Easy Navigation**: Find input code in `src/input/`, graphics in `src/graphics/`
- **? Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different `src/` subdirectories
- **? Faster Builds**: Only recompile changed systems
- **? Maintainable**: Clear system boundaries and responsibilities

## ? **Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Automated (Recommended)**
```bash
./reorganize_project.sh
```
This safely moves the least risky files first and stops before touching core system files.

### **Option 2: Manual**
Follow the detailed phase-by-phase plan in `PROJECT_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md`

## ?? **Important Notes**

1. **Make a backup first** - This reorganizes your entire project structure
2. **Your `/docs` directory is perfect** - don't change it!
3. **Test builds after each phase** - Make sure nothing breaks
4. **Update CMakeLists.txt** - File paths will need updating
5. **Start with safe files** - Assembly, assets, tools first

## ? **Files Created**

- `PROJECT_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` - Complete detailed reorganization plan
- `reorganize_project.sh` - Automated script for safe file moving
- `ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## ? **End Result**

After reorganization, you'll have:
- **Clear project structure** that's easy to navigate
- **Logical grouping** of related files
- **Better team development** workflow
- **Faster compile times** when changing specific systems
- **Professional project organization** that scales well

Your documentation is already excellent - this just brings your file organization up to the same high standard!
